1) Apply Greed
2) Proof Yourself wrong
3) prove yourself correct
 

 lets say i have a bag -> 50 kg (capacity)

 and have 5 metal boxes with respect to weight , price

 Copper (10, 1000), Gold (1, 100000) , Silver (2, 10000), platinum (1, 10^8), iron(50, 2000)


 now applying greed on -> Price/weight

capacity ->50kg
 cutting machine diye packet e dhukaile fractional knapsack

 or na thaakle strick kg hole -0-1 knapsack

25kg -> 200 taka ->400taka->up->8 
30kg -> 300taka -> up -> 10 taka
